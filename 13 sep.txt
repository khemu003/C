-> what is data type ?
	->data type use to store the variable which type of value stored in variable.

-> what is variable ?
	->variable is like container that is used to stored and hold the value(data)
	->it provide memory.

-> types of data type ? 
	->there are two type
		->A) primitive data type
			->like int, float, char etc.
		->B) non-primitive data type
			->like string, array, pointer, etc.

-> what is compiler ?
	->compiler are use to convert source code to machine code
	->It is convert our main.c file to main.obj and than main.exe for execute the program
 
-> what is machine code ?
	-> machine code is a code that understand by only computer
	-> because computer only understand Binary number (0 & 1)
	-> In programming language machine code use .obj extension to convert source code to machine code
